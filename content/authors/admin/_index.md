I am a Research Investigator & Audiologist at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at Oregon Health & Science University. My research interests include the toxic effects of medications on hearing, with a particular focus on medications used to manage and prevent HIV. I am also the founder of the LGBTQ+ affinity group Queer Empowerment for Audiologists, Researchers, and Students (QuEARS).
