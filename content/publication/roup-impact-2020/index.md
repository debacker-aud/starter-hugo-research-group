abstract: 'Purpose This study assessed state anxiety as a function of speech recognition
  testing using three clinical measures of speech in noise and one clinical measure
  of dichotic speech recognition.   Method Thirty young adults, 30 middle-age adults,
  and 25 older adults participated. State anxiety was measured pre– and post–speech
  recognition testing using the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Speech recognition
  was measured with the Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise
  Test, the Words-in-Noise Test, and the Dichotic Digits Test (DDT).   Results Speech
  recognition performance was as expected: Older adults performed significantly poorer
  on all measures as compared to the young adults and significantly poorer on the
  Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test, and the
  Words-in-Noise Test as compared to the middle-age adults. On average, State–Trait
  Anxiety Inventory scores increased posttesting, with the middle-age adults exhibiting
  significantly greater increases in state anxiety as compared to the young and older
  adults. Increases in state anxiety were significantly greater for the DDT relative
  to the speech-in-noise tests for the middle-age adults only. Poorer DDT recognition
  performance was associated with higher levels of state anxiety.   Conclusions Increases
  in state anxiety were observed after speech-in-noise and dichotic listening testing
  for all groups, with significant increases seen for the young and middle-age adults.
  Although the exact mechanisms could not be determined, multiple factors likely influenced
  the observed increases in state anxiety, including task difficulty, individual proficiency,
  and age.'
