abstract: There is evidence of ototoxicity from antiretrovirals (ARVs), and ARV therapy
  in pregnant/nursing mothers can expose offspring to these compounds. The current
  work modelled whether exposure to ARVs in utero and during nursing altered the functioning
  of the auditory system in offspring mice.The females of seven breeding pairs of
  C57BL6/J mice were given daily doses of ARVs lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil
  fumarate by oral gavage during gestation and nursing. Three breeder females were
  given equivalent volumes of water as controls. At wean age (3 weeks after birth),
  the offspring mice were tested with auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). At the
  conclusion of the experiment, the offspring mice's cochleae were examined for hair
  cell counts.Ten breeder female C57BL6/J mice and 69 offspring mice.The offspring
  mice exposed to ARVs during development showed higher ABR thresholds than the control
  offspring. No differences were found in supra-threshold ABRs. There was no evidence
  of missing hair cells.Hearing impairment may be a possible consequence of exposure
  to ARVs during gestation and development. Because the threshold differences were
  not large, if they are occurring in humans, it is unlikely they would be identified
  in any hearing screening tests.
