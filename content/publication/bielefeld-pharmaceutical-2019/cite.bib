 abstract = {One of the ongoing challenges for hearing researchers is successful protection of the ear from noise injury. For decades, the most effective methods have been based on modifying the acoustic properties of the noise, either by reducing noise output from various sources, interfering in the acoustic exposure path with environmental controls, or altering the noise dose for the individual with personal hearing protection devices. Because of the inefficiencies of some of the acoustic modification procedures, pharmaceutical otoprotection is targeted at making the cochlea less susceptible to injury. Short-duration, high-level impulse noises, typically caused by small-scale explosions, cause different sets of injuries in the ear than long-duration, low-variance noise exposures. Therefore, the expectation is that the ears exposed to impulse noise may need different pharmaceutical interventions, both in type of compounds used and the time course of administration of the compounds. The current review discusses four different classes of compounds that have been tested as impulse noise otoprotectants. In the process of describing those experiments, particular emphasis is placed on the acoustic properties of the impulses used, with the goal of providing context for evaluating the relevance of these different models to human impulse noise-induced hearing loss.},
