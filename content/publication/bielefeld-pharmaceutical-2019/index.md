abstract: One of the ongoing challenges for hearing researchers is successful protection
  of the ear from noise injury. For decades, the most effective methods have been
  based on modifying the acoustic properties of the noise, either by reducing noise
  output from various sources, interfering in the acoustic exposure path with environmental
  controls, or altering the noise dose for the individual with personal hearing protection
  devices. Because of the inefficiencies of some of the acoustic modification procedures,
  pharmaceutical otoprotection is targeted at making the cochlea less susceptible
  to injury. Short-duration, high-level impulse noises, typically caused by small-scale
  explosions, cause different sets of injuries in the ear than long-duration, low-variance
  noise exposures. Therefore, the expectation is that the ears exposed to impulse
  noise may need different pharmaceutical interventions, both in type of compounds
  used and the time course of administration of the compounds. The current review
  discusses four different classes of compounds that have been tested as impulse noise
  otoprotectants. In the process of describing those experiments, particular emphasis
  is placed on the acoustic properties of the impulses used, with the goal of providing
  context for evaluating the relevance of these different models to human impulse
  noise-induced hearing loss.
