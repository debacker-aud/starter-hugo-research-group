abstract: 'Purpose: More than 7% of the U.S. population identifies as LGBTQ+ (lesbian,
  gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other identities), meaning clinical audiologists
  in all settings are likely to encounter LGBTQ+ patients seeking audiological services.
  This conceptual clinical focus article (a) introduces contemporary LGBTQ+ terms,
  definitions, and pertinent issues; (b) summarizes the current state of knowledge
  on barriers to equitable hearing health care access and utilization for people who
  identify as LGBTQ+; (c) explores the legal, ethical, and moral obligations for audiologists
  to provide equitable care to people who identify as LGBTQ+; and (d) provides resources
  to continue to learn about salient LGBTQ+ issues.   Conclusions: This clinical focus
  article provides actionable guidance to clinical audiologists on providing inclusive
  equitable care to LGBTQ+ patients. Practical actionable guidance on how clinical
  audiologists can make their clinical practice more inclusive for their patients
  who identify as LGBTQ+ is provided.'
