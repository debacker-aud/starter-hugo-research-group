abstract: While the human's frequency range of audibility has been well documented
  at 20–20 000 Hz, the audible frequency ranges vary considerably from species to
  species. As such, that which constitutes the “high-frequency” range is quite different
  in mice, rats, guinea pigs, gerbils, chinchillas, and cats. These mammalian species
  have been frequently used in anatomical and physiological investigations of the
  peripheral and central auditory nervous systems. Much of what we know about the
  physiology of the auditory system is based upon on these animal species, yet many
  of their auditory systems operate in a much different frequency range from the human's.
  We will discuss the use of auditory electrophysiology to define the high-frequency
  ranges across several different mammal species, and then transition to a comparison
  of their high-frequency ranges to that of the human. Further, we will discuss the
  implications of trying to extrapolate insight into human auditory physiology from
  animal species whose high-frequency ranges are quite different from our own.
