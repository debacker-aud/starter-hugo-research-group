abstract: One of the ongoing challenges for hearing researchers is successful
  protection of the ear from noise injury. For decades, the most effective
  methods have been based on modifying the acoustic properties of the noise,
  either by reducing noise output from various sources, interfering in the
  acoustic exposure path with environmental controls, or altering the noise dose
  for the individual with personal hearing protection devices. Because of the
  inefficiencies of some of the acoustic modification procedures, pharmaceutical
  otoprotection is targeted at making the cochlea less susceptible to injury.
  Short-duration, high-level impulse noises, typically caused by small-scale
  explosions, cause different sets of injuries in the ear than long-duration,
  low-variance noise exposures. Therefore, the expectation is that the ears
  exposed to impulse noise may need different pharmaceutical interventions, both
  in type of compounds used and the time course of administration of the
  compounds. The current review discusses four different classes of compounds
  that have been tested as impulse noise otoprotectants. In the process of
  describing those experiments, particular emphasis is placed on the acoustic
  properties of the impulses used, with the goal of providing context for
  evaluating the relevance of these different models to human impulse
  noise-induced hearing loss.
