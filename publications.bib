	abstract = {There is evidence of ototoxicity from antiretrovirals (ARVs), and ARV therapy in pregnant/nursing mothers can expose offspring to these compounds. The current work modelled whether exposure to ARVs in utero and during nursing altered the functioning of the auditory system in offspring mice.The females of seven breeding pairs of C57BL6/J mice were given daily doses of ARVs lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate by oral gavage during gestation and nursing. Three breeder females were given equivalent volumes of water as controls. At wean age (3 weeks after birth), the offspring mice were tested with auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). At the conclusion of the experiment, the offspring mice's cochleae were examined for hair cell counts.Ten breeder female C57BL6/J mice and 69 offspring mice.The offspring mice exposed to ARVs during development showed higher ABR thresholds than the control offspring. No differences were found in supra-threshold ABRs. There was no evidence of missing hair cells.Hearing impairment may be a possible consequence of exposure to ARVs during gestation and development. Because the threshold differences were not large, if they are occurring in humans, it is unlikely they would be identified in any hearing screening tests.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Purpose
              Platinum-based chemotherapies used to treat many types of cancers are ototoxic. Ototoxicity management (OtoM) to mitigate the ototoxic outcomes of cancer survivors is recommended practice yet it is not a standard part of oncologic care. Although more than 10,000 patients each year are treated with platinum-based chemotherapies at the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), the current state of OtoM in VA is not well-defined. This study reports on a national survey of VA audiologists’ perceptions regarding OtoM in cancer patients.
            
            
              Methods
              A 26-item online survey was administered to VA audiologists and service chiefs across the VA’s 18 regional systems of care. Descriptive statistics and deductive thematic analysis were used to analyze the data.
            
            
              Results
              The 61 respondents included at least one from each VA region. All reported they felt some form of OtoM was necessary for at-risk cancer patients. A pre-treatment baseline, the ability to detect ototoxicity early, and management of ototoxic effects both during and after treatment were considered high value objectives of OtoM by respondents. Roughly half reported routinely providing these services for patients receiving cisplatin and carboplatin. Respondents disagreed regarding appropriate hearing testing schedules and how to co-manage OtoM responsibilities with oncology. They identified barriers to care that conformed to three themes: care and referral coordination with oncology, audiology workload, and lack of protocols.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although VA audiologists value providing OtoM for cancer patients, only about half perform OtoM for highly ototoxic treatment regimens. The OtoMIC survey provides clinician perspectives to benchmark and address OtoM care gaps.
            
            
              Implications for cancer survivors
              Collaboration between oncology and audiology is needed to improve current OtoM processes, so that cancer survivors can have more control over their long term hearing health.},

	abstract = {Over 27 million people worldwide currently receive daily antiretroviral therapy for the management of HIV/AIDS. In order to prevent the continued spread of HIV, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy by pregnant and nursing women. There is currently little research into the auditory effects of this therapy on children exposed during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and research to date on the direct effects of antiretroviral exposure on the auditory system is inconclusive. The current study examined the effects of WHO-recommended first-line antiretrovirals in a well-controlled animal model to evaluate the potential for auditory damage and dysfunction following these exposures. Female breeding mice were each exposed to one of four antiretroviral cocktails or a vehicle control once daily during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Offspring of these mice had their auditory status evaluated after weaning using auditory brainstem responses and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Auditory brainstem response thresholds following antiretroviral exposure during gestation and breastfeeding showed elevated thresholds and increased wave latencies in offspring of exposed mice when compared to unexposed controls, but no corresponding decrease in DPOAE amplitude. These differences in threshold were small and so may explain the lack of identified hearing loss in antiretroviral-exposed children during hearing screenings at birth. Minimal degrees of hearing impairment in children have been correlated with decreased academic performance and impaired auditory processing, and so these findings, if also seen in human children, suggest significant implications for children exposed to antiretrovirals during development despite passing hearing screenings at birth.},

As such, that which constitutes the “high-frequency” range is quite different in mice, rats, guinea pigs, gerbils, chinchillas, and cats. These mammalian species have been frequently used in anatomical and physiological investigations of the peripheral and central auditory nervous systems. Much of what we know about the physiology of the auditory system is based upon on these animal species, yet many of their auditory systems operate in a much different frequency range from the human's. We will discuss the use of auditory electrophysiology to define the high-frequency ranges across several different mammal species, and then transition to a comparison of their high-frequency ranges to that of the human. Further, we will discuss the implications of trying to extrapolate insight into human auditory physiology from animal species whose high-frequency ranges are quite different from our own.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study assessed state anxiety as a function of speech recognition testing using three clinical measures of speech in noise and one clinical measure of dichotic speech recognition.
            
            
              Method
              Thirty young adults, 30 middle-age adults, and 25 older adults participated. State anxiety was measured pre– and post–speech recognition testing using the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Speech recognition was measured with the Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test, the Words-in-Noise Test, and the Dichotic Digits Test (DDT).
            
            
              Results
              Speech recognition performance was as expected: Older adults performed significantly poorer on all measures as compared to the young adults and significantly poorer on the Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test, and the Words-in-Noise Test as compared to the middle-age adults. On average, State–Trait Anxiety Inventory scores increased posttesting, with the middle-age adults exhibiting significantly greater increases in state anxiety as compared to the young and older adults. Increases in state anxiety were significantly greater for the DDT relative to the speech-in-noise tests for the middle-age adults only. Poorer DDT recognition performance was associated with higher levels of state anxiety.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Increases in state anxiety were observed after speech-in-noise and dichotic listening testing for all groups, with significant increases seen for the young and middle-age adults. Although the exact mechanisms could not be determined, multiple factors likely influenced the observed increases in state anxiety, including task difficulty, individual proficiency, and age.},

	abstract = {One of the ongoing challenges for hearing researchers is successful protection of the ear from noise injury. For decades, the most effective methods have been based on modifying the acoustic properties of the noise, either by reducing noise output from various sources, interfering in the acoustic exposure path with environmental controls, or altering the noise dose for the individual with personal hearing protection devices. Because of the inefficiencies of some of the acoustic modification procedures, pharmaceutical otoprotection is targeted at making the cochlea less susceptible to injury. Short-duration, high-level impulse noises, typically caused by small-scale explosions, cause different sets of injuries in the ear than long-duration, low-variance noise exposures. Therefore, the expectation is that the ears exposed to impulse noise may need different pharmaceutical interventions, both in type of compounds used and the time course of administration of the compounds. The current review discusses four different classes of compounds that have been tested as impulse noise otoprotectants. In the process of describing those experiments, particular emphasis is placed on the acoustic properties of the impulses used, with the goal of providing context for evaluating the relevance of these different models to human impulse noise-induced hearing loss.},
