abstract: Over 27 million people worldwide currently receive daily antiretroviral
  therapy for the management of HIV/AIDS. In order to prevent the continued spread
  of HIV, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of highly active
  antiretroviral therapy by pregnant and nursing women. There is currently little
  research into the auditory effects of this therapy on children exposed during pregnancy
  and breastfeeding, and research to date on the direct effects of antiretroviral
  exposure on the auditory system is inconclusive. The current study examined the
  effects of WHO-recommended first-line antiretrovirals in a well-controlled animal
  model to evaluate the potential for auditory damage and dysfunction following these
  exposures. Female breeding mice were each exposed to one of four antiretroviral
  cocktails or a vehicle control once daily during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Offspring
  of these mice had their auditory status evaluated after weaning using auditory brainstem
  responses and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). Auditory brainstem
  response thresholds following antiretroviral exposure during gestation and breastfeeding
  showed elevated thresholds and increased wave latencies in offspring of exposed
  mice when compared to unexposed controls, but no corresponding decrease in DPOAE
  amplitude. These differences in threshold were small and so may explain the lack
  of identified hearing loss in antiretroviral-exposed children during hearing screenings
  at birth. Minimal degrees of hearing impairment in children have been correlated
  with decreased academic performance and impaired auditory processing, and so these
  findings, if also seen in human children, suggest significant implications for children
  exposed to antiretrovirals during development despite passing hearing screenings
  at birth.
