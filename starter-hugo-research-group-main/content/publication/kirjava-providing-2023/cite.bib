 abstract = {Purpose:
More than 7% of the U.S. population identifies as LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other identities), meaning clinical audiologists in all settings are likely to encounter LGBTQ+ patients seeking audiological services. This conceptual clinical focus article (a) introduces contemporary LGBTQ+ terms, definitions, and pertinent issues; (b) summarizes the current state of knowledge on barriers to equitable hearing health care access and utilization for people who identify as LGBTQ+; (c) explores the legal, ethical, and moral obligations for audiologists to provide equitable care to people who identify as LGBTQ+; and (d) provides resources to continue to learn about salient LGBTQ+ issues.


Conclusions:
This clinical focus article provides actionable guidance to clinical audiologists on providing inclusive equitable care to LGBTQ+ patients. Practical actionable guidance on how clinical audiologists can make their clinical practice more inclusive for their patients who identify as LGBTQ+ is provided.},
