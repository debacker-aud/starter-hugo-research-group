abstract: 'Abstract  Purpose Platinum-based chemotherapies used to treat many types
  of cancers are ototoxic. Ototoxicity management (OtoM) to mitigate the ototoxic
  outcomes of cancer survivors is recommended practice yet it is not a standard part
  of oncologic care. Although more than 10,000 patients each year are treated with
  platinum-based chemotherapies at the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), the
  current state of OtoM in VA is not well-defined. This study reports on a national
  survey of VA audiologists’ perceptions regarding OtoM in cancer patients.   Methods
  A 26-item online survey was administered to VA audiologists and service chiefs across
  the VA’s 18 regional systems of care. Descriptive statistics and deductive thematic
  analysis were used to analyze the data.   Results The 61 respondents included at
  least one from each VA region. All reported they felt some form of OtoM was necessary
  for at-risk cancer patients. A pre-treatment baseline, the ability to detect ototoxicity
  early, and management of ototoxic effects both during and after treatment were considered
  high value objectives of OtoM by respondents. Roughly half reported routinely providing
  these services for patients receiving cisplatin and carboplatin. Respondents disagreed
  regarding appropriate hearing testing schedules and how to co-manage OtoM responsibilities
  with oncology. They identified barriers to care that conformed to three themes:
  care and referral coordination with oncology, audiology workload, and lack of protocols.   Conclusions
  Although VA audiologists value providing OtoM for cancer patients, only about half
  perform OtoM for highly ototoxic treatment regimens. The OtoMIC survey provides
  clinician perspectives to benchmark and address OtoM care gaps.   Implications for
  cancer survivors Collaboration between oncology and audiology is needed to improve
  current OtoM processes, so that cancer survivors can have more control over their
  long term hearing health.'
