This study assessed state anxiety as a function of speech recognition testing using three clinical measures of speech in noise and one clinical measure of dichotic speech recognition.


Method
Thirty young adults, 30 middle-age adults, and 25 older adults participated. State anxiety was measured pre– and post–speech recognition testing using the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Speech recognition was measured with the Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test, the Words-in-Noise Test, and the Dichotic Digits Test (DDT).


Results
Speech recognition performance was as expected: Older adults performed significantly poorer on all measures as compared to the young adults and significantly poorer on the Revised Speech Perception in Noise Test, the Quick Speech-in-Noise Test, and the Words-in-Noise Test as compared to the middle-age adults. On average, State–Trait Anxiety Inventory scores increased posttesting, with the middle-age adults exhibiting significantly greater increases in state anxiety as compared to the young and older adults. Increases in state anxiety were significantly greater for the DDT relative to the speech-in-noise tests for the middle-age adults only. Poorer DDT recognition performance was associated with higher levels of state anxiety.


Conclusions
Increases in state anxiety were observed after speech-in-noise and dichotic listening testing for all groups, with significant increases seen for the young and middle-age adults. Although the exact mechanisms could not be determined, multiple factors likely influenced the observed increases in state anxiety, including task difficulty, individual proficiency, and age.},
